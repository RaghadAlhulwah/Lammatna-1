<h1>Lammatna – Event Coordination Platform</h1>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>

<p><strong>Lammatna</strong> is a web-based platform designed to simplify the planning and coordination of small social gatherings. It provides a structured space where all event-related information — such as schedules and responsibilities — can be organized clearly instead of being scattered across group chats.
The platform focuses on improving communication, reducing confusion, and making event planning more efficient and less stressful.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organize event details in one clear and accessible place.</li>
  <li>Improve coordination among participants.</li>
  <li>Encourage stronger social and community connections.</li>
  <li>Support mental well-being by making real-life gatherings easier to plan.</li>
</ul>
</p>
