Lammatna is a web-based platform that makes it easy to organize small group gatherings. 
Instead of planning events through messy group chats, users can create and manage gatherings in one organized place. 
The platform lets you set the event’s time and location, 
assign tasks to participants, and send automatic reminders — helping everyone stay on the same page. 
Lammatna makes event planning simple, structured, and stress-free.
